# opencv_app
A navigation tool constructed for the Hack the North 2021 hackathon to register left clicks with the closing of a fist

Unfortunately, since my knowledge of computer vision isn't very deep, I resorted to using only HSV values for detecting the user's hand. As a result, the app may have limited or no functionality for  users who may have backgrounds and skin tones that may conflict with the HSV values used for myself.
